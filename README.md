## About The Project

Retrospective boards are extremely useful within the Scrum workflow, particularly during the last of the four basic ceremonies for each sprint or software release, the sprint retrospective. This app allows users to manage their projects by categorizing what went well, what needs improvement, and what steps to take next within color-coded and easy to read boards!

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
- yarn
  ```sh
  npm install --g yarn
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KatieBullock/retro-board.git
   ```
2. Install packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Run the app
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

## Usage

Users can add an item card to a category by clicking the '+' button at the top of the category. They will immediately be prompted to type in a task. After the item has been added, the users have the ability to move the card to another category or delete the card altogether by clicking the corresponding buttons on the bottom of the card.

Oftentimes, retro boards are used in group settings to discuss project goals. To encourage input from team members, there is a heart button on each card. Team members can vote on the items they believe are the most important to focus on or just let their colleagues know how happy they are that a particularly difficult task was accomplished.

Depending on the style of the meeting, users can change the layout style from columns to rows by clicking on the button in the upper left.
